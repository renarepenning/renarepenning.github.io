Hello! I am an Associate Java Developer at Morgan Stanley with experience in back-end development, cloud computing, project management, and agile scrum methodologies. I received Newcomb Institute's Oak Wreath award and a Leadership Medallion from Tulane Orientation upon my graduation in 2022.

I was a 2021 Summer Analyst within the Technology practice at Barclays. Throughout last summer and my senior year, I assisted Dr. Carola Wenk with her research in computational geometry. During my junior year I was a full-time student while working 17 hours a week; tutoring students through Juni Learning, and serving as a Teacher's Assistant for Intro to Computer Science I & II (CMPS1500 & CMPS1600) at Tulane. Grace Hopper Celebration Grant 2020, 2021 recipient.

Additionally, I have experience in database management and creation, web development, digital archiving, teaching STEM concepts, and team leadership. At Tulane, I am involved in multiple mentorship programs and privately tutor Statistics and Calculus. In my free time, I enjoy running and reading political and financial news.
